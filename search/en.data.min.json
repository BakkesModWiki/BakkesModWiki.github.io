After a function is hooked, any time it is called by Rocket League, your code is called as well. Many useful ones are documented in Commonly Hooked Functions. If you want to better understand them or hook a function that\u0026rsquo;s undocumented, hopefully this page will help.\nThere are multiple types of hooks. First are the two simpler ones. gameWrapper is a GameWrapper and will be accessible from any point in your code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 gameWrapper-\u0026gt;HookEvent(\u0026#34;Function TAGame.Car_TA.SetVehicleInput\u0026#34;, [this](std::string eventName) { // Your Code here // Call another function or just do your things here }); gameWrapper-\u0026gt;HookEventPost(\u0026#34;Function TAGame.Car_TA.SetVehicleInput\u0026#34;, [this](std::string eventName) { // Your Code here }); HookEvent runs your code as the function is called HookEventPost runs your code as the function is returned from They return a std::string which is the name of the calling function. This is useful to differentiate what your caller is if you have multiple hooks calling the same code.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 gameWrapper-\u0026gt;HookEventWithCaller\u0026lt;CarWrapper\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;Function TAGame.Car_TA.SetVehicleInput\u0026#34;, [this](CarWrapper caller, void* params, std::string eventname) { // Your Code here }); gameWrapper-\u0026gt;HookEventWithCallerPost\u0026lt;CarWrapper\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;Function TAGame.Car_TA.SetVehicleInput\u0026#34;, [this](CarWrapper caller, void* params, std::string eventname) { // Your Code here }); The two WithCaller variants do the same thing, but let you know a bit more about what is using the function\nThey provide a caller value which is obtained from the function\u0026rsquo;s name. After Function TAGame there will be a class name ending in _TA. If the name matches a wrapper name, you can hook it as that wrapper. Car_TA becomes CarWrapper for example. The image below breaks up a function call into parts. The class is GameEvent_TA, which can be cast to a ServerWrapper.\nThe hook also provides a void * pointer. This points at the location of any parameters provided to the function. These aren\u0026rsquo;t well documented, and are hard to guess, so feel free to ask about them if you think you need them. A couple useful functions and parameters can be found in Commonly Hooked Functions\nFor example Function TAGame.Car_TA.OnHitBall has a BallWrapper parameter. To access it, cast the void * pointer to a struct including the parameters\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 struct CarHitBallParams { // This is a pointer to the ball\u0026#39;s address // but needs to be constructed into a BallWrapper before use uintptr_t ball; }; gameWrapper-\u0026gt;HookEventWithCallerPost\u0026lt;CarWrapper\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;Function TAGame.Car_TA.OnHitBall\u0026#34;, [this](CarWrapper caller, void* params, std::string eventname) { // This cast is only safe if you\u0026#39;re 100% sure the params are correct CarHitBallParams* params = (CarHitBallParams*) params; BallWrapper ballHit = BallWrapper(params-\u0026gt;ball); // Now you know what ball was hit! }); Find functions with the function scanner\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/plugin_tutorial/starting_a_plugin/","title":"2. Starting a plugin","parent":"Plugin Tutorial","content":"It will assume you\u0026rsquo;re using the template as linked in Setting Up. You can of course make a plugin without it, but it gives an easier basis to work off of. You can name it anything, but here we\u0026rsquo;ll be using a demo plugin named CoolPlugin\nThe template has a lot of commented out code that is designed to help you learn how to use the syntax. We\u0026rsquo;ll uncomment some of this as we go along.\nFirst we\u0026rsquo;ll look at your CoolPlugin.h file. It describes any functions your code will use. At the top are two lines that are required for plugins, and allow you to call BakkesMod SDK functions 1 2 #pragma once #include \u0026#34;bakkesmod/plugin/bakkesmodplugin.h\u0026#34; Next is the declaration of your class. Here you describe any functions you will be using. onLoad() is automatically called by BakkesMod when the plugin is loaded, and onUnload() is called when it is unloaded. The unLoad isn\u0026rsquo;t totally necessary, but we\u0026rsquo;ll uncomment it to demonstrate 1 2 3 4 5 class CoolPlugin: public BakkesMod::Plugin::BakkesModPlugin { void onLoad() override; void onUnload() override; }; Now we will look at the CoolPlugin.cpp file. Here you write the code that will define the functions\nFirst it includes your header so it can define the functions described above\n1 2 #include \u0026#34;pch.h\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;CoolPlugin.h\u0026#34; Next it declares the plugin. The string in \u0026quot;\u0026quot; will be used in the plugin manager to describe the plugin, but it needs to be a short description. Keep it to 1 or two words. You can also define a plugin version, although the template handles that automatically. Finally is the plugin type. These don\u0026rsquo;t do anything, so just use PLUGINTYPE_FREEPLAY. Your plugin will still work in any playlist and mode.\n1 BAKKESMOD_PLUGIN(CoolPlugin, \u0026#34;Cool Plugin\u0026#34;, plugin_version, PLUGINTYPE_FREEPLAY) Next you define your functions, starting with onLoad(). The template already has an onload. As this is a demo, we\u0026rsquo;ll just do a hello world. 1 2 3 4 5 6 void CoolPlugin::onLoad() { // This line is required for LOG to work and must be before any use of LOG() _globalCvarManager = cvarManager; // do something when it loads LOG(\u0026#34;Hello I\u0026#39;m CoolPlugin B)\u0026#34;); } Next is onUnload(). Bakkesmod handles most of unloading, so only worry about this if your code is using some 3rd party library that needs unloading to be handled specially. For now this can just add the new function to the bottom of CoolPlugin.cpp and log that it unloaded 1 2 3 void CoolPlugin::onUnload() { LOG(\u0026#34;I was too cool for this world B\u0026#39;(\u0026#34;); } Now you\u0026rsquo;ve got a super basic plugin. Hit Build -\u0026gt; Build CoolPlugin or press ctrl + B to finalize the plugin. It will create CoolPlugin.dll in a plugins/ folder next to your plugin source code. It will also move it into your bakkesmod folder if you are using the template.\nNow open Rocket League and open the BakkesMod console with f6. Type plugin load CoolPlugin and you should see it load and say hello! If you unload it with plugin unload CoolPlugin you should see it say goodbye to you 😢\nNext we\u0026rsquo;ll make the plugin actually do something. We\u0026rsquo;ll reverse engineer the ballontop command, which puts the ball on top of your car in freeplay. In CoolPlugin.h add a new function 1 2 3 4 5 6 class CoolPlugin: public BakkesMod::Plugin::BakkesModPlugin { virtual void onLoad(); virtual void onUnload(); void ballOnTop(); }; We need to define that function in CoolPlugin.cpp. Just jump to the end of the file and add 1 2 3 void CoolPlugin::ballOnTop() { } ⠀ The next lines of code are all going to be within CoolPlugin::ballOnTop() in CoolPlugin.cpp\nFirst we need to make sure we should be running the plugin. We only want it to work in freeplay. The gameWrapper gives a ton of useful functions to figure out what context the code is being run from. The first line of CoolPlugin::ballOnTop() will be 1 if (!gameWrapper-\u0026gt;IsInFreeplay()) { return; } There are also gameWrapper-\u0026gt;IsInGame() and gameWrapper-\u0026gt;IsInOnlineGame() if you\u0026rsquo;d rather your plugin run elsewhere\nThe next line will be getting the ServerWrapper. This is what controls pretty much everything in the current game. You can get players, cars, the ball, the goals, and other things from it so it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly useful. We also nullcheck it. If you call functions on a null server Rocket League will crash 1 2 ServerWrapper server = gameWrapper-\u0026gt;GetCurrentGameState(); if (!server) { return; } Next we get the ball and nullcheck it 1 2 BallWrapper ball = server.GetBall(); if (!ball) { return; } And we get the car. As this is freeplay we only have one to worry about, but in any mode this will select your car. And we nullcheck it. If this seems redundant, it isn\u0026rsquo;t. What if your car was demolished? Without this nullcheck, you\u0026rsquo;d crash your game if you ran the command before the respawn. 1 2 CarWrapper car = gameWrapper-\u0026gt;GetLocalCar(); if (!car) { return; } Next we can start manipulating things. We can grab the car\u0026rsquo;s velocity and assign it to the ball so they match. If the ball is going slower or faster than the car, it\u0026rsquo;ll just fly off by itself 1 2 Vector carVelocity = car.GetVelocity(); ball.SetVelocity(carVelocity); Next we\u0026rsquo;ll actually move the ball. A Vector is a 3 dimensional point in space. The Z axis is up and down in Rocket League, so we can put the ball above the car by using the car\u0026rsquo;s location and adding distance on the Z axis. 1 2 3 Vector carLocation = car.GetLocation(); float ballRadius = ball.GetRadius(); ball.SetLocation(carLocation + Vector{0, 0, ballRadius * 2}); We\u0026rsquo;ve now defined CoolPlugin::ballOnTop() In full: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 void CoolPlugin::ballOnTop() { if (!gameWrapper-\u0026gt;IsInFreeplay()) { return; } ServerWrapper server = gameWrapper-\u0026gt;GetCurrentGameState(); if (!server) { return; } BallWrapper ball = server.GetBall(); if (!ball) { return; } CarWrapper car = gameWrapper-\u0026gt;GetLocalCar(); if (!car) { return; } Vector carVelocity = car.GetVelocity(); ball.SetVelocity(carVelocity); Vector carLocation = car.GetLocation(); float ballRadius = ball.GetRadius(); ball.SetLocation(carLocation + Vector{0, 0, ballRadius * 2}); } Now we need to call the function\nThis can be done with a notifier. These can be called with a console command to activate your code. Here we\u0026rsquo;ll define it as CoolerBallOnTop because Bakkes\u0026rsquo; ballontop is for the birds. When it\u0026rsquo;s called, it takes a vector (basically a list) of command arguments that were provided by the command. Here we don\u0026rsquo;t care about those, so they are unused. The code is called in a lambda [](){}. You can just copy the syntax here. Next is the notifier description, which does nothing, so it\u0026rsquo;ll be \u0026quot;\u0026quot;. Finally is the permissions, which decides when the notifier works. It should usually be PERMISSION_ALL, as that works anywhere.

Then start freeplay, load the plugin with plugin load CoolPlugin and call CoolerBallOnTop from the f6 console. The ball should teleport above you!\nIf you want your plugin to load automatically on startup, you can use the plugin manager in game (under the \u0026ldquo;Plugins\u0026rdquo; tab in the BakkesMod menu) and toggle the \u0026ldquo;Loaded\u0026rdquo; checkbox for your plugin.\nYou can find the final code here! https://github.com/ubelhj/BakkesModStarterPlugin/tree/new-starter-tutorial\nNow what if you wanted a user to be able to modify plugin behavior on the fly?

There\u0026rsquo;s way more events out there than can be documented, so you can find one yourself with the function scanner\nI highly recommend this video I made to understand how to use it, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a text guide below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDZ1wWKE8aw\nSet the -dev option On Steam: Right click the game and hit properties Then add the option\nOn Epic:\nHit Settings Scroll down to Rocket League, enable Additional Command Line arguments, then add -dev\nReboot and open scanner Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve enabled -dev, reboot rocket league with bakkesmod open Once injected, open the console with f6 and type togglemenu devtools The scanner will now open\nUse the scanner You can select any words you think are relevant and add them to the whitelist. Any words that aren\u0026rsquo;t relevant can be added to the blacklist. Separate words with , but no space a, b will match a and [space]b. When you hit apply, any functions containing words matching the whitelist and not matching the blacklist will appear. These will appear as they happen, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good way to find out when functions fire, and what timing you want. This video does a much better job of explaining this part\nHook the Function When you\u0026rsquo;ve found the right function, hook it using gameWrapper-\u0026gt;HookEvent(). Details here. Every time that function happens, your code will be run. This can be used to know when something important happens (a goal), get pointers to hard-to-find wrappers, or just be used to help you do something on a consistent timer.\nIf you want to use the caller, the Bakkesmod caller will be based off of the Rocket League calling class / calling object name. Most functions are called by classes named Something_TA. Remove the _TA at the end and look for any wrappers with similar names. If a wrapper matches, that is the caller. For example, \u0026quot;Function TAGame.Car_TA.OnHitBall\u0026quot; is called by a Car_TA. The prefix is Car, so it\u0026rsquo;s wrapped by CarWrapper. Not all callers are wrapped though. If you absolutely need the caller and it\u0026rsquo;s unwrapped, ask for help and give some reasoning as to why you need the caller. If it\u0026rsquo;s useful, it might be added to BakkesMod.\nThis image shows the breakdown of the function name\nHooks are the hardest part of Bakkesmod programming, but can have the most interesting results\n"},{"id":82,"href":"/bakkesmod_api/Classes/Wrappers/GameObject/FXActorWrapper/","title":"FXActorWrapper","parent":"Game Object","content":" View Implementation unsigned long GetbDeactivateWhenOwnerDestroyed() void SetbDeactivateWhenOwnerDestroyed(unsigned long newbDeactivateWhenOwnerDestroyed) Parameter Type Description newbDeactivateWhenOwnerDestroyed unsigned long \u0026mdash;

This github page describes what 3D space is in Rocket League\nSome additional notes:\nRotator applies rotations in the order yaw-pitch-roll. The identity rotation for a car (i.e. P=Y=R=0) corresponds to the car being upright with its nose pointing towards the positive x-axis. If the car were at the center of the field, its nose would face towards the left mid-boost, from the blue team's perspective. Example: to get a car facing straight up, wheels toward the orange goal, you could yaw 90 degrees right, then pitch up 90 degrees. This corresponds to P=16383, Y=16383, R=0. You could also yaw 90 degrees left, pitch 90 degrees up, then roll 180 degrees.

Plugin Variables","parent":"Plugin Tutorial","content":"Next we will make your plugin alterable by a user. They might want to enable/disable the plugin, change how it acts, and pretty much infinite options. I\u0026rsquo;ll be using a fairly simple plugin I\u0026rsquo;ve made as an example. I\u0026rsquo;ll only be focusing on the settings, not the actual code that makes it work. We\u0026rsquo;ll continue the CoolPlugin from Starting a Plugin\nWe give the users control with the Console Variables, CVars. They allow a user to set a variable\u0026rsquo;s value, and for our code to know when those values are changed. These can be used for string, int, bool, float, or color values. They also can persist across multiple sessions, so user settings are saved. If something being changed to the wrong value can break your plugin, don\u0026rsquo;t use a CVar. Any internal plugin logic that can do unintended things if modified should be stored and controlled with class variables declared in your .cpp or .h files.\nTo create one, we call cvarManager-\u0026gt;registerCvar() There are 2-9 arguments. The first 2 are required, but the others are not\nThe name. This should include your plugin name and make sense The default value as a string. If it\u0026rsquo;s a boolean, remember 0 is false and 1 is true A description of the CVar as a string. The name can describe your variable well, so this isn\u0026rsquo;t super necessary Whether your CVar is searchable. If someone starts typing the name of your CVar, and this is true it suggests the CVar. Defaults to true Whether your CVar has a minimum value. Defaults to false The minimum value of your CVar if it exists. If the previous is false this value can be anything and is ignored Whether your CVar has a maximum value. Defaults to false The maximum value of your CVar if it exists. If the previous is false this value can be anything and is ignored Whether the CVar\u0026rsquo;s value is stored between sessions. Defaults to true To create an enable/disable CVar for the plugin and a ball distance CVar 1 2 cvarManager-\u0026gt;registerCvar(\u0026#34;cool_enabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Enable Cool\u0026#34;, true, true, 0, true, 1); cvarManager-\u0026gt;registerCvar(\u0026#34;cool_distance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;200.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Distance to place the ball above\u0026#34;); A user can use these by typing into the f6 console cool_enabled 1 to enable cool, or cool_distance 300 to move the ball away\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ve got the CVar. But what do we do with it? There\u0026rsquo;s two good ways to use it. Either we can do something when the value is changed, or we can get the value from the CVar as we use the value\nFirst is CVarWrapper.addOnValueChanged() This creates a function that is called when the value is changed. Quite simple. The string simply is what the old value was. The CVarWrapper holds the new value. The [](){} is called a lambda, and is basically just a helper function. We put [this] so we can access our global variables inside the lambda. (std::string oldValue, CVarWrapper cvar) are the values passed to the lambda by the addOnValueChanged function. Every time the value changes and the lambda is called, the code inside {} happens. The most common use is to change the value of a global variable. If I had a variable bool coolEnabled, I could call coolEnabled = cvar.getBoolValue(); inside the brackets to change its value 1 2 3 4 cvarManager-\u0026gt;registerCvar(\u0026#34;cool_enabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Enable Cool\u0026#34;, true, true, 0, true, 1) .addOnValueChanged([this](std::string oldValue, CVarWrapper cvar) { coolEnabled = cvar.getBoolValue(); }); The second is by getting the CVar and then its value in another function. We can call cvarManager-\u0026gt;getCvar() with the name of any CVar to get and/or set the value of that CVar, even ones that aren\u0026rsquo;t from our plugin. 1 2 3 CVarWrapper distanceCVar = cvarManager-\u0026gt;getCvar(\u0026#34;cool_distance\u0026#34;); if (!distanceCVar) { return; } float distance = distanceCVar.getFloatValue(); We can put together this knowledge to add to CoolPlugin.cpp\nhttps://github.com/ubelhj/BakkesModStarterPlugin/blob/plugin-variables/CoolPlugin/CoolPlugin.cpp\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t enough though. Who wants to be changing an integer value with a console command? Gross. What if we had sliders? Checkboxes? Buttons? Next we\u0026rsquo;ll add a simple GUI\nPlugin Interface\n"},{"id":238,"href":"/functions/commonly_hooked_functions/","title":"Commonly Hooked Functions","parent":"Functions","content":"This is a list of functions that we use regularly, as well as when they fire. We\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to document them all but hopefully this helps. Hook them with Function Hooks\nThe Bakkesmod caller will be based off of the Rocket League calling class / calling object name. Most functions are called by classes named Something_TA. Remove the _TA at the end and look for any wrappers with similar names. If a wrapper matches, that is the caller. For example, \u0026quot;Function TAGame.Car_TA.OnHitBall\u0026quot; is called by a Car_TA. The prefix is Car, so it\u0026rsquo;s wrapped by CarWrapper. Not all callers are wrapped though.\nThis image shows the breakdown of the function name.

Never call on or change any Rocket League / Bakkesmod values here. If you do, you will crash. It\u0026rsquo;s happening outside of the game, and cannot safely alter it. That means that if you have a CVarWrapper.addOnValueChanged() that alters the state of the game, it will be unsafe to use here\n1 2 3 void CoolPlugin::RenderSettings() { ImGui::TextUnformatted(\u0026#34;A really cool plugin\u0026#34;); } Lets start building the plugin interface. First we\u0026rsquo;ll have a button that\u0026rsquo;ll call CoolerBallOnTop. The button as well as most other interactable ImGui components has a boolean property. If it\u0026rsquo;s true, that means it\u0026rsquo;s been interacted with. So when the button has been clicked, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the cvarManager to call CoolerBallOnTop. But CoolerBallOnTop uses the ServerWrapper and alters the game. It\u0026rsquo;ll crash! We can wrap it inside gameWrapper-\u0026gt;Execute(). We\u0026rsquo;ll also add hover text because why not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 if (ImGui::Button(\u0026#34;Ball On Top\u0026#34;)) { gameWrapper-\u0026gt;Execute([this](GameWrapper* gw) { cvarManager-\u0026gt;executeCommand(\u0026#34;CoolerBallOnTop\u0026#34;); }); } if (ImGui::IsItemHovered()) { ImGui::SetTooltip(\u0026#34;Activate Ball On Top\u0026#34;); } Now let\u0026rsquo;s do a checkbox for cool_enabled. First we need to get the CVar, then use it. The bool enabled is necessary, as the checkbox uses that to store whether or not the checkbox should be checked. You can\u0026rsquo;t just use the CVar 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 CVarWrapper enableCvar = cvarManager-\u0026gt;getCvar(\u0026#34;cool_enabled\u0026#34;); if (!enableCvar) { return; } bool enabled = enableCvar.getBoolValue(); if (ImGui::Checkbox(\u0026#34;Enable plugin\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;enabled)) { enableCvar.setValue(enabled); } if (ImGui::IsItemHovered()) { ImGui::SetTooltip(\u0026#34;Toggle Cool Plugin\u0026#34;); } And finally a slider for the distance CVar.

You\u0026rsquo;re going to crash the game at some point. This will tell you how to learn from a crash and solve your issue.\nCrashes are often logged in .dmp files. They are found at My Documents/My Games/rocketleague/TAGame/Logs\nUnfortunately sometimes there is no .dmp file. That often means you crashed in a non-game thread, like rendering or websockets. For those you might just need to do some logging to find out where you crashed\nMake sure you have the exact version of the source code that crashed the game and the .pdb of that exact build loaded in a visual studio project. For this I highly recommend using git. Even for private projects, this can save you when you have to look back at old versions of code. Make a commit for the source code that you\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded to bakkesplugins.\nDrag the .dmp over the visual studio window\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll get a Minidump File Summary, which explains in super basic terms what the issue was. It won\u0026rsquo;t be specific though, so hit the green \u0026ldquo;Debug with Native Only\u0026rdquo; button\nNext it will try to load symbols. If this is taking more than a couple seconds, it\u0026rsquo;s loading too many symbols. Cancel the loading and go to Debug -\u0026gt; Options -\u0026gt; Symbols\nMake sure that Microsoft Symbol Servers is the only symbol location selected and that Load only specified modules is selected\nThen try to debug with native again. Be aware that these settings mysteriously can reset themselves (they did so in the time it took me to write this up) so you might have to refer back here fairly often.\nIf Visual Studio can find the issue, it will then tell you the issue and automatically jump to it. I dereferenced a null pointer! Oops\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a little less easy, and the issue happens in pluginsdk.dll or RocketLeague.exe. In this case Visual Studio will try its best to find it but may fail\nThis crash happened because of a null ball! Remember the best practices! Whenever you use any type that ends with Wrapper like this BallWrapper you must nullcheck it before using it. These 4 lines of code will save your plugin from crashing\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 BallWrapper* ball = (BallWrapper*) nullptr; if (!ball) { LOG(\u0026#34;null ball\u0026#34;); // I am saved from crashing! return; } // guaranteed to only happen on valid balls and not crash ball-\u0026gt;SetLocation(Vector(0, 0, 0)); Once you\u0026rsquo;ve found the issue, hit the red square up top\nHopefully you\u0026rsquo;ve found your issue.

If a log doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen that you expected to, you likely crashed before that statement.

The ImageWrapper is a resource managing class. This means that you have to keep this object \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo; as long as you want to use the image. When the object goes out of scope \\ gets destructed it cleans up the resource it manages. Stick to std::shared_ptr and you almost can\u0026rsquo;t mess up. See all ImageWrapper functions here Add the declaration to your .h 1 std::shared_ptr\u0026lt;ImageWrapper\u0026gt; myImage; Using an ImageWrapper Use the constructor with the second or third argument true (or both). This can cause stuttering based on the size of the image. This is best done in your plugin\u0026rsquo;s onLoad. You only need to load the image once, and onLoad is expected to be a bit stuttery already 1 2 // ImageWrapper(std::string path, bool canvasLoad = false, bool ImGuiLoad = false); myImage = std::make_shared\u0026lt;ImageWrapper\u0026gt;(gameWrapper-\u0026gt;GetDataFolder() / \u0026#34;MyPluginFolder\u0026#34; / \u0026#34;MyImage.png\u0026#34;, true, true); Load the resource if you didn\u0026rsquo;t use the optional args. This also causes lag so it\u0026rsquo;s best to do this in onLoad or in a place that isn\u0026rsquo;t called often 1 2 myImage-\u0026gt;LoadForCanvas(); myImage-\u0026gt;LoadForImGui(); a. Pass it to the canvas wrapper in a drawable callback after ensuring it\u0026rsquo;s loaded 1 2 3 4 if (myImage-\u0026gt;IsLoadedForCanvas()) { canvas.DrawTexture(myImage.get(), 1); // there are multiple functions in the canvaswrapper that accept ImageWrapper* } b. Use it in your imgui render code. Again checking that it\u0026rsquo;s loaded 1 2 3 4 if (myImage-\u0026gt;IsLoadedForImGui() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; auto pTex = myImage-\u0026gt;GetImguiTex()) { auto rect = myImage-\u0026gt;GetSizeF(); ImGui::Image(pTex, { rect.width, rect.height }); } PS: The backend will load in the resource whenever you try to use the images if it hasn\u0026rsquo;t already been loaded. So you actually don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about it, but the loading can cause some lag\\stutters. So it\u0026rsquo;s better to do it during loading the plugin - when such behaviour can be expected.\n"},{"id":250,"href":"/code_snippets/how_cvars_work/","title":"How CVars Work","parent":"Code Snippets","content":"Cvars are the global variables of the mod.

This is where onLoad() is fired, CVars are created and default values are set for each plugin. Then config.cfg will execute, which will set saved-values.\nTo save a value, you need to call \u0026lsquo;writeconfig\u0026rsquo; in the console, or programmatically with:\n1 cvarManager-\u0026gt;executeCommand(\u0026#34;writeconfig\u0026#34;, false); //false just means don\u0026#39;t log the writeconfig The config.cfg file containes all cvars/alias. Find this file in bakkesmod/cfg/config.cfg. This file is your route to easily saving CVars across sessions. Note that \u0026lsquo;writeconfig\u0026rsquo; will also execute binds.cfg, and save current keybinds.\nIf you want to reload a plugin while BM is running already but keep its values, make sure you use writeconfig before the plugin is unloaded, then unload/load or reload the plugin, now the plugin will have registered it cvars, but with default values. Then execute config.cfg to get your stored values back.

It is still easy to find a not listed plugin though, so only make a plugin visible if you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with it being public\nNext upload a .png banner for the plugin. It should be below 50 MB? and wider than it is tall. 16 x 9 is a reasonable ratio.\nFinally is the plugin .zip. Make a .zip file including all of your source files and nothing else. You should include the .sln, the .vcxproj, any .cpp, .h, or .hpp files, and any other additional data files like .set or images to be included.\nIf you have the .sln outside the solution folder, include the green checked files\nIf you have the .sln inside the solution folder, include the green checked files\nOnce you have everything just hit submit! All plugins are manually reviewed and built by volunteer moderators. It may take a couple days to a couple weeks depending on moderator availability. Please be respectful of the time it may take. Please use the plugin template to make building to .dll smooth and easy for the moderators.\nIf your plugin uses any third party dependencies. Please see plugin dependecies\nIf your plugin includes any .dll files from outside sources or has weird build steps, please make it clear through a README or by asking in the discord. We will do our best to accomodate special exceptions if the plugin clearly needs it and moderators are capable of getting files from a safe source. For example Nvidia Highlights requires a pre-built .dll from Nvidia themselves, as it was easily accessible we were able to package that in a plugin download. If it\u0026rsquo;s unreasonably difficult to obtain outside source files or build the plugin, it will be denied\nBakkesplugins retains the right to deny or remove any plugin. A plugin will not be approved if it can be considered malicious, downloads and/or runs potentally dangerous files, breaks the Rocket League Code of Conduct\u0026rsquo;s rules for mods, or is otherwise not allowed by Psyonix\n"},{"id":262,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Welcome to the BakkesMod Programming Wiki!","content":""},{"id":263,"href":"/code_snippets/toasts/","title":"Toasts","parent":"Code Snippets","content":"Toasts are cool little popups that show on the top right of your game\nThese are useful for quick notifications that you want to disappear quickly\nFirst you need to enable them in f2 - Misc - Enable notifications\nWatch out though! Every user also has to enable this, so make sure your plugin page or interface is quite clear that this is necessary\nNow to the code\nMake a toast pop up with GameWrapper.Toast()\nThere are 7 parameters. The first two are required. They are\nThe title, which is the word on top The text, which is the smaller text below The texture name which I\u0026rsquo;ll explain in the next paragraph The time to show the toast, which defaults to 3.5 seconds The ToastType, which chooses the color and defaults to black The width in pixels. The toast automatically resizes to fit your text, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry about these too much The height in pixels If you want to have a custom image, load it in your onLoad() using GameWrapper.LoadToastTexture(). Provide the function with a name for your toast, and the path to the image. Most likely you\u0026rsquo;ll want it to be in the data folder.\nToasts can be one of 4 colors based on the ToastType\nI\u0026rsquo;ve made an example using CoolPlugin. I put this code in the onLoad() in CoolPlugin.cpp and cool.png in the bakkesmod/data folder 1 2 3 4 5 gameWrapper-\u0026gt;LoadToastTexture(\u0026#34;cool\u0026#34;, gameWrapper-\u0026gt;GetDataFolder() / \u0026#34;cool.png\u0026#34;); cvarManager-\u0026gt;registerNotifier(\u0026#34;cool_toast\u0026#34;, [this](std::vector\u0026lt;std::string\u0026gt; args) { gameWrapper-\u0026gt;Toast(\u0026#34;Whoa you\u0026#39;re cool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Super cool\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cool\u0026#34;, 5.0, ToastType_Warning); }, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, PERMISSION_ALL); The result when I call cool_toast from the f6 console\nFor perspective, it\u0026rsquo;s quite small but still legible\nFull code here https://github.com/ubelhj/BakkesModStarterPlugin/tree/toasts\n"},{"id":264,"href":"/useful_info/troubleshooting_bakkesmod/","title":"Troubleshooting Bakkesmod","parent":"Useful Info","content":"Made it here because your BakkesMod isn\u0026rsquo;t working?
