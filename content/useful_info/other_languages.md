### [ARCHIVED]
###### This page is archived and kept around to showcase what has existed in the past. As of writing, the only accepted way to submit plugins to BakkesPlugins is with the plugin template from the tutorial section. Of course, no one can stop you from writing plugins in any way you desire but there will be no one around to help with getting stuff working. Moreover, distribution submissions won't be accepted

There's a couple super useful libraries that let you write plugins in other programming languages. We can't really guarantee any tutorials in this server as we don't have anyone with much experience in them. If you use them feel free to add help and make a pull request. You're still welcome to ask for help with them in the [discord](https://discord.gg/HMptXSzCvU), but most people here use the standard C++ library and it may be hard to get specific help
