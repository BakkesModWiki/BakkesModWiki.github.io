After Downloading the Plugin Template, you will be granted with this snippet of code in your `PluginName`.h
# The Template
```cpp
class PluginName: public BakkesMod::Plugin::BakkesModPlugin
	//,public SettingsWindowBase // Uncomment if you wanna render your own tab in the settings menu
	//,public PluginWindowBase // Uncomment if you want to render your own plugin window
{

	//std::shared_ptr<bool> enabled;

	//Boilerplate
	void onLoad() override;
	//void onUnload() override; // Uncomment and implement if you need a unload method

public:
	//void RenderSettings() override; // Uncomment if you wanna render your own tab in the settings menu
	//void RenderWindow() override; // Uncomment if you want to render your own plugin window
};

```
At the top of this snippet of code generated by the [BakkesmodTemplate](https://github.com/Martinii89/BakkesmodPluginTemplate), you should see commented `SettingsWindowBase` and `PluginWindowBase`
These are classes that your plugin can inherit that will be used by bakkemod to render your gui the way you want it to be rendered.

Near the bottom of this snippet of code there are 2 functions commented `RenderSettings` and `RenderWindow`. These have comments on the same line that describe what they do!


RenderSettings: Shows up in F2->Plugins->YourPlugin \
RenderWindow: Shows up in your plugins personal window

# Opening your personal window (RenderWindow) through code:
```cpp
gameWrapper->Execute([this](GameWrapper* gw) {
    cvarManager->executeCommand("togglemenu " + GetMenuName());
});
```
running the command without gameWrapper->Execute could be unsafe and may crash your game. \
`cvarManager->executeCommand` mimics pressing F6 and typing a command!
Although not every plugin needs to have RenderWindow! Stick to what your plugin needs. If its just some checkboxes and sliders then there is no need for RenderWindow!
It is perfectly fine to only use RenderSettings, RenderWindow is not always needed.
# Combining everything
`GuiBase.cpp`
```cpp
#include "PluginName.h"
void PluginName::RenderSettings() {
	ImGui::Text("My Cool Settings!");
	if (ImGui::Button("Open my Cool Personal Window!")) {
		gameWrapper->Execute([this](GameWrapper* gw) {
			cvarManager->executeCommand("togglemenu " + GetMenuName());
		});
	}
}
void PluginName::RenderWindow() {
	ImGui::Text("My Cool Personal Window!");
}
```
