      <title>Using Function Hooks</title>

      <description>Function hooks are a powerful part of BakkesMod. After a function is hooked, any time it is called by Rocket League, your code is called as well. Many useful ones are documented in Commonly Hooked Functions. If you want to better understand them or hook a function that&amp;rsquo;s undocumented, hopefully this page will help.&#xA;There are multiple types of hooks. First are the two simpler ones. gameWrapper is a GameWrapper and will be accessible from any point in your code.</description>

      <description>Trying to hook an event but don&amp;rsquo;t know what event to use? There&amp;rsquo;s way more events out there than can be documented, so you can find one yourself with the function scanner&#xA;I highly recommend this video I made to understand how to use it, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a text guide below https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDZ1wWKE8aw&#xA;Set the -dev option On Steam: Right click the game and hit properties Then add the option</description>

      <description>This is a list of functions that we use regularly, as well as when they fire. We&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to document them all but hopefully this helps. Hook them with Function Hooks&#xA;The Bakkesmod caller will be based off of the Rocket League calling class / calling object name. Most functions are called by classes named Something_TA. Remove the _TA at the end and look for any wrappers with similar names.</description>

      <title>Hook Event With Any Caller</title>

      <description>Add this to your plugin header and you can hook with caller for &amp;ldquo;anything&amp;rdquo;. This will do a blind cast, so make absolutely sure you&amp;rsquo;re hooking the right function or you will crash. There are no type checks here!&#xA;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 template &amp;lt;typename T, typename std::enable_if&amp;lt;std::is_base_of&amp;lt;ObjectWrapper, T&amp;gt;::value&amp;gt;::type*&amp;gt; void GameWrapper::HookEventWithCaller(std::string eventName, std::function&amp;lt;void(T caller, void* params, std::string eventName)&amp;gt; callback) { auto wrapped_callback = [callback](ActorWrapper caller, void* params, std::string eventName) { callback(T(caller.</description>

      <title>Modify vehicle inputs</title>
      <link>https://bakkesmodwiki.github.io/functions/set_vehicle_input/</link>

      <description>Modifying vehicle input in BMSDK is only possible in offline modes or local games. Since this is a frequent ask, here is a resource page on how to do it.&#xA;The trap: don&amp;rsquo;t use SetInput Many aspiring programmers find the CarWrapper::SetInput function and think that their prayers are answered. Unfortunately, this function does not work particularly well. It is best to steer clear of this one entirely.&#xA;The good-enough: consider PlayerControllerWrapper::SetVehicleInput The function PlayerControllerWrapper::SetVehicleInput is simple to use and works well enough for most purposes.</description>

      <title>Stat Events</title>

      <description>Stat events are a great way to show a slightly more complicated plugin logic. They are fairly common to use, use multiple wrappers, event hooks, and have some unique caveats. Also I made a plugin with them so I know how they work. Hopefully this helps someone&#xA;First add this include to the top of your .h&#xA;#include &amp;quot;bakkesmod/wrappers/GameObject/Stats/StatEventWrapper.h&amp;quot;&#xA;You need to hook some events to use stat events. This depends on your use case.</description>
